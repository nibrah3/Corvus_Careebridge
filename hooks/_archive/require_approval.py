"""
require_approval.py — PreToolUse hook.

Blocks Bash / humanizer / UIA tool calls unless the current job_id has been
explicitly approved via AskUserQuestion in this session.

Approval is recorded in E:\Corvus_Careebridge\.approval_state.json by the session logic
when Mike taps [Apply] on a job.

Exit codes:
  0 — proceed
  2 — block (Claude Code surfaces the message to the user)
