hook_trigger_discovery.py - PostToolUse hook (Module 6 quality gate)
Fires after mcp__vps__trigger_discovery.

What it does:
  1. Acknowledges the VPS discovery job has started
  2. Instructs Claude to launch the enrichment pipeline as a background Bash command
     so newly discovered jobs get official URLs and a PDF batch broadcast to all users
  3. Shows the Jobs sub-menu

The enrichment pipeline (enrich_jobs.py):
  - Finds all unenriched jobs in DB
  - Firecrawls platform URLs to extract official employer URLs
  - Firecrawls official URLs for authoritative job descriptions
  - Updates DB: official_url, official_description, enriched=True
  - On completion: generates batch PDF and broadcasts to all Telegram users
