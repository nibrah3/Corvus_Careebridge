"""
Gemini Video MCP server — screen recording + Gemini 2.0 Flash video analysis.

Tools:
  start_recording    Start DXcam screen capture (background thread)
  stop_recording     Stop recording, save MP4
  upload_video       Upload MP4 to Gemini File API
  analyse_video      Ask Gemini about an uploaded video
  analyse_image      Ask Gemini about a local screenshot (inline, no upload)
  delete_file        Remove file from Gemini quota

Primary use case — video/image annotation assessments:
  Alison and similar platforms sometimes show a short video clip or image and ask
  "what is the person doing?" or "identify the object at timestamp X."
  Claude Code cannot watch video directly. This MCP records the screen while
  the video plays, uploads the recording to Gemini Flash, and asks Gemini
  for a structured description — which Claude Code then uses to answer.

Workflow:
  start_recording(fps=5)
  [user presses Play on assessment video]
  stop_recording(output_path="C:/tmp/clip.mp4")
  upload_video("C:/tmp/clip.mp4")                → {uri: "files/xxx"}
  analyse_video(uri, "Describe what happens")    → {text: "A person is ..."}
  delete_file("files/xxx")                        → cleanup

For image annotations (no recording needed):
  screenshot() from capture MCP → save to disk
  analyse_image("C:/tmp/frame.jpg", "What is shown?")

Requirements:
  pip install google-generativeai
  GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable set to your Gemini API key.
